    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I joined the Osaka Web3.0 Master Creator Project to address Japan's low talent mobility and skill mismatches,
        which hinder growth and productivity. SSICerts aims to leverage Web3 technologies like Verifiable Credentials
        (VC) and Soulbound Tokens (SBT) to create a DAO platform for secure, user-controlled talent data and transparent
        job matching. While the project's overall goal is to reshape talent and credential management, my contribution
        primarily focused on developing a portion of the credential issuance system, which forms a critical component of
        the platform's future direction.</p>
