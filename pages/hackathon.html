    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My first Hackathon. I participated in a hackathon with a team of three people I met online, where we clearly
        divided our rolesâ€”two members focused on backend development while I took responsibility for frontend
        development. To ensure the final integration would go smoothly, we maintained close communication through
        Discord and Notion, organizing regular meetings and discussions via calls. This structured approach helped us
        stay on track and combine our efforts seamlessly, resulting in a fully functional final product.</p>
